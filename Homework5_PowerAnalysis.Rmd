Homework 5 - power analyses
```{r}


library(pwr)

#create a list of effect sizes roughly matching the range of correlations reported in Joshi et al
effect_sizes <- seq(from = 0.1, to = 0.6, by = 0.01)

#create empty list for sample size numbers
data_samples <- c()

for (i in effect_sizes) {
  
#conduct the power analysis for 80% power
placeholder <- pwr.r.test(r = i, power = 0.8)
#extract just the sample size
calculated_n <- placeholder$n

#append sample size to the list at the beginning
data_samples <- append(calculated_n, data_samples)

}

#reverse the order so it matches the sequence order
data_samples <- rev(data_samples)

#combine data in a dataframe
final_power_analysis <- data.frame("effect_sizes" = effect_sizes, "samples_needed_for_80%_power" = data_samples)

#plot
plot(final_power_analysis$effect_sizes, final_power_analysis$samples_needed_for_80._power, xlab = "effect size", ylab = "samples needed for 80% power", main = "power analysis")
