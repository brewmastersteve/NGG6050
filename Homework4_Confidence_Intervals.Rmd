Homework 4: 95% Confidence Intervals

Since we have a known standard deviation (sigma), we can use method 1, the z-score method, for all sample sizes even the ones with a small sample size which would typically require a t-distribution.
```{r}
#create vector of sample sizes to run
sample_sizes <- c(5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 1000)

#add given statistics
mu <- 10
sigma <- 2

#create an empty list for upper and lower CI limits for the below loop to put values into
lower_limit_list <- c()
upper_limit_list <- c()


for (n in sample_sizes) {

  #calculate SEM
  SEM <- sigma/sqrt(n)
  
  #compute scaling factor with a z value of 1.96 for 95%, that we'll use to add and subtract from the mean
  scaling_factor <- SEM*1.96
  
  #calculate lower and upper limits with the scaling factor
  lower_limit_stat <- mu - scaling_factor
  upper_limit_stat <- mu + scaling_factor
  
  #add those limits to the lists created at the beginning
  lower_limit_list <- append(lower_limit_stat, lower_limit_list)
  upper_limit_list <- append(upper_limit_stat, upper_limit_list)

}

#reverse the lists so they are in the correct order that matches the order of "sample_sizes"
lower_limit_list <- rev(lower_limit_list)
upper_limit_list <- rev(upper_limit_list)

#add everything together in a nice dataframe
confidence_intervals <- data.frame("N" = sample_sizes, "lower_limit" = lower_limit_list, "upper_limit" = upper_limit_list)
View(confidence_intervals)

```
