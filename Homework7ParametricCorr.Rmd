Homework 7 - parametric correlation coefficient

Q1: Do they look related?
A: see below plot, yes it looks like it
```{r}

wing_length <- c(10.4,10.8,11.1,10.2,10.3,10.2,10.7,10.5,10.8,11.2,10.6,11.4)
tail_length <- c(7.4,7.6,7.9,7.2,7.4,7.1,7.4,7.2,7.8,7.7,7.8,8.3)


plot(wing_length, tail_length, xlab = "wing length", ylab = "tail length")


```
Q2: calculate r manually, then with the R function
```{r}
#manually

#get the means
xbar <- mean(wing_length)
ybar <- mean(tail_length)

#create some empty lists
numerator <- c()
X_SS <- c()
Y_SS <- c()

total_iterations <- seq(from = 1, to = length(wing_length), by = 1)

for (i in total_iterations) {
  
  
  num_placeholder <- (wing_length[i]-xbar)*(tail_length[i]-ybar)
  x_placeholder <- (wing_length[i]-xbar)^2
  y_placeholder <- (tail_length[i]-ybar)^2
  
  numerator <- append(num_placeholder, numerator)
  X_SS <- append(x_placeholder, X_SS)
  Y_SS <- append(y_placeholder, Y_SS)
  
  
}

#final statistic, just summing the things from the for loop
manual_r <- sum(numerator)/(sqrt(sum(X_SS))*sqrt(sum(Y_SS)))

print(paste("manually calculated r is", manual_r))



#with r function
the_r_function <- cor(x = wing_length, y = tail_length)

print(paste("the r function calculated r is", the_r_function))

if(identical(manual_r,the_r_function) == TRUE){
  
  print("both ways are identical")
}

if(identical(manual_r,the_r_function) == FALSE){
  
  print("both ways are not identical")
}
```
Q3: Standard error and CI
```{r}

#standard error
# Calculate the sample size (n)
n <- as.numeric(length(wing_length))  # or length(y)

# Calculate the standard error of the correlation
standard_error <- sqrt((1 - the_r_function^2) / (n - 2))

print(paste("standard error is", standard_error))


#CI

alpha <- 0.05  # 95% confidence level
z_alpha_over_2 <- qnorm(1 - alpha / 2)

# Calculate the confidence interval
lower_bound <- the_r_function - z_alpha_over_2 * standard_error
upper_bound <- the_r_function + z_alpha_over_2 * standard_error

# Print the confidence interval
cat("95% Confidence Interval: [", round(lower_bound, 4), ", ", round(upper_bound, 4), "]\n")
```
Q4: Significance?
```{r}

t_statistic <- the_r_function/standard_error

if(t_statistic > 1.96){
  cat("Yes significant because t statistic,",t_statistic,", is beyond ± 1.96, the cutoff for significance here.")
}

if(t_statistic < 1.96){
  cat("No significant because t statistic,",t_statistic,", is not beyond ± 1.96, the cutoff for significance here.")
}

```
Q5: Is our correlation different from Yale's?
```{r}
#make appropriate transformations
our_transformation <- 0.5*log(x = (1+the_r_function)/(1-the_r_function), base = exp(1))
yales_transformation <- 0.5*log(x = (1+0.75)/(1-0.75), base = exp(1))

#calculate
calculated_gamma <- (our_transformation-yales_transformation)/(sqrt(1/(n-3)))

if(calculated_gamma > 1.96){
  cat("Yes significant because gamma,",calculated_gamma,", is beyond ± 1.96, the cutoff for significance here. So Yale's is different from ours.")
}

if(calculated_gamma < 1.96){
  cat("No significant because gamma,",calculated_gamma,", is within ± 1.96, the cutoff for significance here. So Yale's is the same as ours.")
}
  
  
```
Q6: Power and sample size
```{r}
library(pwr)
#first run the loop to determine sample sizes for 80% power

#create a list of effect sizes
effect_sizes <- seq(from = 0.5, to = 0.95, by = 0.05)

#create empty list for sample size numbers
data_samples <- c()

for (i in effect_sizes) {
  
#conduct the power analysis for 80% power
placeholder <- pwr.r.test(r = i, power = 0.8)
#extract just the sample size
calculated_n <- placeholder$n

#append sample size to the list at the beginning
data_samples <- append(calculated_n, data_samples)

}

#reverse the order so it matches the sequence order
data_samples <- rev(data_samples)

#combine data in a dataframe
final_power_analysis_sample_sizes <- data.frame("r_values" = effect_sizes, "samples_needed_for_80percent_power" = data_samples)





#then run it to determine power from a sample size of 10


#create a list of effect sizes
effect_sizes <- seq(from = 0.5, to = 1, by = 0.05)

#create empty list for sample size numbers
data_samples <- c()

for (i in effect_sizes) {
  
#conduct the power analysis for n = 10
placeholder <- pwr.r.test(r = i, n = 10)
#extract just the sample size
calculated_power <- placeholder$power

#append sample size to the list at the beginning
data_samples <- append(calculated_power, data_samples)

}

#reverse the order so it matches the sequence order
data_samples <- rev(data_samples)

#combine data in a dataframe
final_power_analysis_powers <- data.frame("r_values" = effect_sizes, "power_for_sample_size_of_10" = data_samples)

library(plyr)
#combine both results
final_power_analysis <- join_all(list(final_power_analysis_sample_sizes,final_power_analysis_powers))

cat("View the 'final_power_analysis' dataframe for power and sample size values.")
