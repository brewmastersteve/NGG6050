Homework 2

In the below article, the authors explored the relationship between IQ and learning disability (LD) diagnoses, noting that a dual gifted and LD diagnosis occurs which presents a contradiction.  In order to do this, they relied on a random sample of students with learning disability diagnoses which presumably had a normal distribution of IQs.

Lovett, B. J., & Sparks, R. L. (2010). Exploring the diagnosis of “Gifted/LD”: Characterizing postsecondary students with learning disability diagnoses at different IQ levels. Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment, 28(2), 91-101.


A classic IQ bell curve, which likely matches the distribution of IQs in the students tested.
```{r}

# Create sample range of IQ scores
iq_range <- seq(30, 170, by = 1)

#set parameters based on the IQ standard
the_mean <- 100
the_sd <- 15

# Calculate probability density for each IQ score
iq_density <- dnorm(iq_range, the_mean, the_sd)

# Plot the  curve
plot(iq_range, iq_density, type = "l", lwd = 3, col = "red", xlab = "IQ", ylab = "Probability Density", main = "IQ Bell Curve")

```
